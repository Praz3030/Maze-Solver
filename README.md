# Maze-Solver

### The Maze Solver is a web-based application that allows users to generate and solve mazes using different pathfinding algorithms. The interactive interface provides buttons to generate a new maze, generate a random end point, reset the maze, and solve it using A*, DFS, or BFS algorithms. The application is designed with a neon purple theme for a visually appealing experience.

## Features
Maze Generation: Create a new maze with the click of a button.
Random End Generation: Randomly place the end point of the maze.
Reset Functionality: Clear the maze and reset to the initial state.
Pathfinding Algorithms: Solve the maze using A*, Depth-First Search (DFS), or Breadth-First Search (BFS).
Responsive Design: Ensures compatibility across various devices and screen sizes.

## Techniques Used
<h3>HTML and CSS</h3> </br>
HTML: Provides the structure of the web application. </br>
CSS: Styles the application with a neon purple theme. Responsive design is implemented using media queries to ensure the application looks good on all devices.</br>
<h3>JavaScript</h3></br>
Interactivity: Uses JavaScript to handle user interactions, such as button clicks for generating and solving the maze.</br>
Maze Generation: Utilizes the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to generate the maze.</br>

## Pathfinding Algorithms:</br>
A*: Finds the shortest path by considering both the cost to reach a node and the estimated cost to the goal.</br>
DFS: Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.</br>
BFS: Explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.</br>

## Algorithmic Pathfinding</br>
Depth-First Search (DFS): Used for maze generation, ensuring a unique and solvable maze every time. </br>
Breadth-First Search (BFS): Explores nodes level by level, guaranteeing the shortest path in an unweighted graph.</br>
A*: An advanced algorithm that combines the benefits of BFS and a heuristic approach to find the shortest path efficiently.</br>

## User Experience Enhancements </br>
Visual Feedback: CSS transitions and distinct colors are used to indicate the current position, target, visited cells, and the path taken.</br>
Intuitive Controls: Buttons are provided for easy interaction with the maze and algorithms.</br>

## How to Use</br>
Generate a New Maze: Click the "Generate Another Maze" button to create a new maze.</br>
Generate Random End: Click the "Generate Random End" button to place the end point randomly within the maze.</br>
Reset the Maze: Click the "Reset The Maze" button to clear the maze and start over.</br>
Solve the Maze: Click on "Solve By A*", "Solve By DFS", or "Solve By BFS" to find the path from the start to the end using the respective algorithm.</br>
